# 📝 To-Do List Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a simple and responsive To-Do List web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them. Tasks are saved using `localStorage` to ensure they persist across browser reloads or restarts.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- ✅ **Add Task**: Users can enter a task and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
- ☑️ **Mark as Completed**: Clicking the checkbox strikes through the task name.
- ❌ **Remove Task**: Each task has a delete button to remove it manually.
- 💾 **Persistence**: Tasks and their completed states are saved in localStorage.
- 🧩 **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.
